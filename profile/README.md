# AI Ledger

AI Ledger is a Git-native, append-only governance standard for AI-assisted software development.

As agentic AI tools increasingly modify production systems, velocity goes up — but traceability often goes down. AI Ledger restores intent clarity, scope discipline, and immutable change history directly inside your repository.

## What it provides
